# todo-app

This project is bootstrapped by [aurelia/new](https://github.com/aurelia/new).

## Known bugs

## Roadmap

- add a "review new" mode to prompt the user to populate their recently created / incomplete items
- add ability to export and import data
- add ability to restore deleted items (currently soft-deleting them and keeping in the database)
- add a better mechanism to promote "this is what you should do today"
- inform the user if there are already several items scheduled for a selected date
- recommend dates without assigned work
- recommend dates with other items of the same context (To help the user with context stability)
- publish to a public page for people to use
